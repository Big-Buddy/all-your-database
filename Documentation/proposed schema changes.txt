Schema needs to account for the following behavior in the app:

	-> Requirement # 2 - Instead of using an enum for city/province of a user we leave those as varchars in the User table and create a new Locations table with tuples holding many cities to one province this seems like a better solution considering we need to have this information available in some kind of dropdown selection - based on the requirements of this project we can assume Canada is the only valid country for this context

	-> Requirement # 7 - It seems that we require some form of detection for expired ads, no actual qualifications for what an expired ad is is described but we should provide something in the database to handle this. Perhaps a bit or boolean isExpired? Is it possible to make a constraint check where if (TIME_NOW - PostingDate) >= MAX_UPTIME_FOR_AD then we set the value of isExpired to true?

	-> Requirement # 12 - It states that a user can rate an item AFTER they have completed the transaction for said item. Thus we need a way to validate a user rating. My suggestion would be to add a link (foreign key) between User, Ads, and Payments.
